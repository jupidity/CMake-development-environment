## Overview
---

a development environment for `C/C++` using `CMake` in a `Linux` system (in my case `Ubuntu 16.04`)

the directory can be opened in a code editor of choice (vim, emacs, atom, visual studio)

* main code is written in `main.cpp`

* custom libraries ``.h`` and ``.cpp`` files are written in the `src` directory

* compilation is performed in the base directory shell by running cmake:

      $ cmake

  and compiles to a build folder

* executable can be run after compilation by shell command

      $ ./[executable]
* debugging can be performed using `gdb`
